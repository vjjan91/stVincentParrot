# Spatial analysis of BirdNET detections

In this script, we carry out spatial analyses of acoustic detections that were thresholded in the previous script. We work with a subset of detections that have a 95% probability of being a true positive.  

## Load necessary libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
library(extrafont)
library(sf)
library(raster)
library(stars)
library(spatstat)
library(mapview)

# for plotting
library(scales)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggspatial)
library(colorspace)
library(scico)

```

## Load acoustic data and metadata
```{r}
metadata <- read.csv("data/acoustic-metadata.csv")
acoustic_data <- read.csv("results/datSubset.csv")
```

## Visualizing sampling effort

How much acoustic data was collected? Using information on the first and last date of recorded acoustic data, we could visualize the total recorded days across months and sites.

```{r}

  mutate(survey_point_ordered = factor(survey_point_number,
